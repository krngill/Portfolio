    <h2>Introduction: </h2>
    <p>In this project, I designed a simple console-based Rock,<br> Paper, Scissors game using C#. <br>
        The game allows users to play against a computer opponent<br> in the classic Rock, Paper, Scissors
        challenge. <br>The program employs fundamental concepts of C# programming, <br>including user input,conditional
        statements,
        loops,<br> and random number generation.</p>



    <h2>Features:</h2>
    <p>
        1.User Interaction:<br>
        The program begins by prompting the user to choose between <br>"ROCK," "PAPER," or "SCISSORS."<br>
        User input is case-insensitive and validated to ensure a valid choice is made.</p>
    <p>
        2.Computer Choice:<br>
        The computer's choice is randomly generated using the Random<br>
        class in C#. It can select "ROCK," "PAPER," or "SCISSORS."</p>


    <p>3.Determining the Winner:<br>
        The game logic determines the winner based on the classic <br>Rock, Paper, Scissors rules.<br>
        If the user and computer choices are the same, the game results in a tie.<br>
        Win-lose scenarios are determined using conditional statements.<br></p>

    <p>
        4.Play Again:<br>
        After each round, the user is given the option to play again.<br>
        The game continues until the user decides not to play anymore..<br></p>




    <h2>Code Structure:</h2>
    <p>

        The program follows a structured C# code with a Main method as the entry point.<br>
        A while loop is used to allow the user to play multiple rounds until they decide to stop.<br>
        Methods like GetComputerChoice and DetermineWinner are employed for code modularity and readability.<br></p>
